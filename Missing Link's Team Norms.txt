    •    Transparency: avoid hidden agendas.
    •    Be genuine with each other about ideas, challenges, and feelings.
    •    Trust each other. Have confidence that issues discussed will be kept in confidence.
    •    Team members will practice a consistent commitment to sharing all the information they have. Share the complete information that you have up front.
    •    Listen first to understand, and don’t be dismissive of the input received when we listen.
    •    Practice being open-minded.
    •    Don’t be defensive with your colleagues.
    •     Rather than searching for the guilty, give your colleagues the benefit of the doubt; have a clean slate process.
    •     Support each other - don't throw each other under the bus.
    •    It's okay to not know the right answer and to admit it. The team can find the answer.
    •    Problems are presented in a way that promotes mutual discussion and resolution.
    •    Practice and experience humility - each of us may not have all the answers.
    •    If you commit to doing something – do it. Be accountable and responsible for the team.
    •    It is okay to be the messenger with bad news. You can expect a problem-solving approach, not recrimination.
    •    Promise to come prepared to your meetings and projects so that you demonstrate value and respect for the time and convenience of others.

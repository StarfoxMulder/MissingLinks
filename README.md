Master repo for second Bootcamp group project


The name of this app (and our team) is Missing Links.

This app is intended to be a place where people can find/offer incomplete sets of things (for example, someone has lost one earring and is searching for it's mate, someone else can post an item they have that they think someone else might be looking for).
 
The database will contain tables for users, available items, and items wanted.
Likewise we will have a landiing page, a page to search for items, a page to add items, and a page to purchase items.

Potential New Technology will be PayPal for processing paymebts.

Public dataset: Still reserching but want to find something to use to display articles (or a link) about waste and recycling.

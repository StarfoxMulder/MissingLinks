-- Create and checkout a branch

git checkout -b <BranchName>

////
This creates a new local branch for you to work on.
\\\\


-- To push the new local version of the branch to github

git push -u origin <BranchName>

////
This creates an 'upstream' version of your local branch within Github.
You only have to do the '-u origin <BranchName> the first time you push
with this new branch.  After that, Github will default to pushing your changes
to the branch you're connected with in Github.

CJP todo before push on itemPage:
- split insertOne into available and wanted in orm
- create toggle option on posting page to alter which route the request is directed to (post/available or post/wanted depending on if the item being posted is for an available or wanted item)
- make new models for available and wanted instead of single item model
- be mindful not to alter anythign related to the 'individual item page' when splitting out the post/pull of items into available and wanted
- need to make separate listA and listW pages for listing out available and wanted items
- need to maek seaparate itemA and itemW pages due to split of everything else into these categories (seems weird, but trust me, it's necessary in order to target the desired item between the two tables)
- make sure models/model are all in there appropriately (they should all be models since we have mutiple within that folder)

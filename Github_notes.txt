-- Create and checkout a branch

git checkout -b <BranchName>

////
This creates a new local branch for you to work on.
\\\\


-- To push the new local version of the branch to github

git push -u origin <BranchName>

////
This creates an 'upstream' version of your local branch within Github.
You only have to do the '-u origin <BranchName> the first time you push
with this new branch.  After that, Github will default to pushing your changes
to the branch you're connected with in Github.

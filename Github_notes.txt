-- Create and checkout a branch

git checkout -b <BranchName>

////
This creates a new local branch for you to work on.
\\\\


-- To push the new local version of the branch to github

git push -u origin <BranchName>

////
This creates an 'upstream' version of your local branch within Github.
You only have to do the '-u origin <BranchName> the first time you push
with this new branch.  After that, Github will default to pushing your changes
to the branch you're connected with in Github.
\\\\

-- To pull the branch into local master branch, be in Master

git merge <branchName>
[[ reconcile conflicts within local master ]]
git add -A
git commit -m ""
git push origin master

-- To bring the most recent version of the master into the local version of your personal branch

git checkout <branchName>
git merge master
[[ reconcile conflicts wihtin local <branchName> ]]
[[ do your work on this up-to-date version of <branchName> | when you want to push your local version of <branchName> to your remote version of <branchName> continue with the following ]]
git add -A
git commit -m ""
git push


CJP todo before push on itemPage:
- split insertOne into available and wanted in orm
- create toggle option on posting page to alter which route the request is directed to (post/available or post/wanted depending on if the item being posted is for an available or wanted item)
- make new models for available and wanted instead of single item model
- be mindful not to alter anythign related to the 'individual item page' when splitting out the post/pull of items into available and wanted
- need to make separate listA and listW pages for listing out available and wanted items
- need to make seaparate itemA and itemW pages due to split of everything else into these categories (seems weird, but trust me, it's necessary in order to target the desired item between the two tables)
- make sure models/model are all in there appropriately (they should all be models since we have mutiple within that folder)

- Review express, briefly (13.2, 13.3, 14.1)
